# Does Uncertainty Estimation for Perception in Automated Driving Help for Planning
Agents in real-world scenarios like automated driv-
ing deal with uncertainty in their environment, in particular
due to perceptual uncertainty. Although, reinforcement learning
is dedicated to autonomous decision-making under uncertainty
these algorithms are typically not informed about the uncertainty
currently contained in their environment. On the other hand,
uncertainty estimation for perception itself is typically directly
evaluated in the perception domain, e.g., in terms of false
positive detection rates or calibration errors based on camera
images. Its use for deciding on goal-oriented actions remains
largely unstudied. In this paper, we investigate how an agentâ€™s
behavior is influenced by an uncertain perception and how
this behavior changes if information about this uncertainty is
available. Therefore, we consider a proxy task, where the agent is
rewarded for driving a route as fast as possible without colliding
with other road users. For controlled experiments, we introduce
uncertainty in the state space by perturbing the perception of
the given agent while informing the latter. Our experiments show
that an unreliable observation space modeled by a perturbed
perception leads to a conservative driving behavior of the agent.
Furthermore, when adding the information about the current
uncertainty directly to the state space, the agent adapts to the
specific situation and in general accomplishes its task faster while,
at the same time, accounting for risks\\
